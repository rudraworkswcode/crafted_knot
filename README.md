This is a vibe coded webpage using Google Gemini Pro.
This webpage was made for the final project submission of Innovation and Design Thinking.
The webpage is titled "The Crafted Knot".
It features 5 distinct sections.
The home page is a design viewing section. It showcases the multiple products available with a smooth transition showing various views of the same.
The materials section showcases the variety of materials available at the workshop. It contains detailed descriptions of the materials used.
The get quote section helps you choose a design from the home page and choose the materials to make the same. This is still a placeholder feature.
The get quote section also has an AI model generator which showcases a 3D model just based on the prompts given.
The track order section shows the progress of the order when the correct id is entered. This is still a placeholder feature.
The about us section shows the history and helps the user empathise and understand the wood workshop in a detailed manner.
